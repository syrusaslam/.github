## Inspiration
As music producers, we feel that music production is a severely underrepresented niche in the field of machine learning and generative AI. We wanted to help supercharge the human race by bringing the newest global revolution to your DAW.

## What it does
Melodify is a plugin for the music production software Ableton Live. We utilize the Max for Live platform along with the Ableton LiveAPI to integrate seamlessly with your workflow and provide fresh melodic and harmonic ideas based on the context of the project. Melodify is made possible by streaming MIDI JSON data over UDP to and from an open source GenAI model hosted on Hugging Face. This is the heart of the entire platform, and after much fine tuning, works as the perfect digital musician's assistant.
